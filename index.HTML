    <h1>How to use the mining platform</h1>
    <h1>Connecting via metamask</h1> <br>
    The approvement window should pop up automatically. If it didnt happen, press the "connect" button in the
    upper right corner.

    <h1>Getting a mining card</h1>
    <div class="text-align">
    Using mining platform requires you to have a mining card wich are available on the
     <a href="https://exchange.artonline.site/#!/market">exchange.</a> There is also an exchange on the mining platform.
     Celect a preferable mining card and press buy. <br>
     <img class="workspace-img" src="./img/module_buy.png" alt="">
      A pop up metamask window should appear. Press confirm, 
     the card you bought is now yours. If it didnt happen, make sure the transaction was successful.
    </div>

     <h1>Activating the card</h1>
     Go to Pools and select the pool of your mining card. Your card should load within 30 seconds. <br>
     <img class="workspace-img" src="./img/module_activation.png" alt="">
     Press the pink triangle next to your miner. Confirm the transaction and voila! Your card is now activated!
     To deactivate the card do the same thing.
     <br>
     If a user holds an ArtOnline NFT Graphics Card, and that card is activated,
      it will continue to provide passive returns until the card is de-activated.
      After de-activation the user has the option to sell at premium prices,
       sell for less on the exchange or, (coming soon) auction the NFT to the highest bidder.
       <br>
       <br>
       <h1>Claiming rewards</h1>
       To claim the rewards go to the mining pool and press "Get reward" button. <br>
       <img class="workspace-img" src="./img/module_claim.png" alt="">
       These 2 buttons will pop up. Claim now (20% tax) means 20% of your mined artonline will get deducted 
       (15% burned and 5% credited to the staking pool), but you get
       the reward right after transaction. So if you mined 10000 artonline you only get 8000. <br>
        Stake for 6 months means you wont be able to use your artonline for 6 months,
        but no tax.
