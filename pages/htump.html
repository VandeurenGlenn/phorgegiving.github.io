        <h1>Getting a mining card</h1>
        <div class="text-align">
        Using mining platform requires you to have a mining card wich are available on the
         <a href="https://exchange.artonline.site/#!/market" class="link">exchange.</a> There is also an exchange on the mining platform.
         Celect a preferable mining card and press buy. <br>
         <img class="workspace-img" src="..../img/module_buy.png" alt="">
          A pop up metamask window should appear. Press confirm, 
         the card you bought is now yours. If it didnt happen, make sure the transaction was successful. 
            </div>

        <h1>Miners ROI</h1>
        Roi means return on investment. So if you bought a miner for 7000 and its ROI is 1 year it means 
        you mine 7000 back in 3 years. Heres miners ROI. At current artonline price Genesis miner has the fastest ROI.
        
        <img class="workspace-img" src="../img/ROI.png" alt="">
        <h4 class="warning">(Data is measured according to full pool.)</h4>
      </article><article>
    
         <h1>Activating the card</h1>
         Go to Pools and select the pool of your mining card. Your card should load within 30 seconds. <br>
         <img class="workspace-img" src="../img/module_activation.png" alt="">
         Press the pink triangle next to your miner. Confirm the transaction and voila! Your card is now activated!
         To deactivate the card do the same thing.
         <br>
         If a user holds an ArtOnline NFT Graphics Card, and that card is activated,
          it will continue to provide passive returns until the card is de-activated.
          After de-activation the user has the option to sell at premium prices,
           sell for less on the exchange or, (coming soon) auction the NFT to the highest bidder.
           </article>
           <br> <article>
           <h1>Spinner</h1>
           A spinner can be activated on each nft gpu, It increases mining by 1% and costs 3500 art 
           to activate. In a pool of 3 GPUs you can activate up to 3 spinners for a total of 3% mining bonus on the pool. So if you
           have 5 modules you can only activate 5 spinners.
          </article> <br> <article>
           <h1>Claiming rewards</h1>
           To claim the rewards go to the mining pool and press "Get reward" button. <br>
           <img class="workspace-img" src="../img/module_claim.png" alt="">
           These 2 buttons will pop up. Claim now (20% tax) means 20% of your mined artonline will get deducted 
           (15% burned and 5% credited to the staking pool), but you get
           the reward right after transaction. So if you mined 10000 artonline you only get 8000. <br>
            Stake for 6 months means you wont be able to use your artonline for 6 months,
            but no tax. 
          </article>  <article>
            <h1>Using calculator</h1>
            Calculator shows how much artonline will be mined in selected amount of time.
            <img src="../img/calculator.png" alt="1" class="workspace-img">
            Select your pool in "GPU" field.
            Enter current pool size for selected miner in "miners" field. Enter amount of your miners in "GPU'S" field.
            You get the result in Art/min.
